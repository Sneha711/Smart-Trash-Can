There are two python files:
1] mail_ultrasonic_distance.py
2] servo_ultrasonic_distance.py

-mail_ultrasonic_distance.py is a file which detects user proximity and accordingly opens and closes the trash can.
-servo_ultrasonic_distance.py is a file which detects if the trash can is full, and when its full(i.e when it crosses certain distance threshold), it sends mail to the user.

To make the Smart Trash Can work run both the files on raspberry pi. For that follow the steps:
1] Open terminal and access the raspberry pi from it.
2] Run both the files.
